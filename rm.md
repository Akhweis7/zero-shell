- Differences
  - Error message on metadata failure:
    - Current: `rm: <path>: <err>` (uses the actual path).
    - Old: tries `rm: {}: {}` with `target` (undefined variable) â†’ compile error.
  - Directory without -r:
    - Current: `rm: <path>: is a directory`.
    - Old: `rm: cannot remove directory (use -r)` (more user-friendly wording but less specific).
  - Both use `symlink_metadata`, so symlinks are unlinked (not followed), and both remove dirs only with `-r`.

- Which is better?
  - Current is better: it compiles (fixes the `target` bug), reports the exact failing path, and matches typical `rm` behavior. The old message for the non-`-r` case is friendlier, but the undefined `target` makes it broken.
